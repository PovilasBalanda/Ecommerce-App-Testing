# Testing an E-commerce App

These are some tests I wrote for an E-commerce app that was written through a codealong. 

The E-commerce app code itself is not written by me, I just coded along to a Udemy course.

The files where the code was written by me are located in /tests and /page_objects.

Steps to run the tests:

1. Install Node.js.
2. Pull the app and test code from the repo.
3. Install the dependencies through the terminal with "npm install".
4. Run the app through the terminal with "nodemon index.js".
5. On a seperate terminal, run the tests with "npm run codeceptjs".

The tests are only written for the sign up and sign in pages for the admin panel.
