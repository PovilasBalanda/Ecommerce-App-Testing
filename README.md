# Testing an E-commerce App

These are some tests I wrote for an E-commerce app that was written through a codealong.

The files where I wrote the code are located in /tests and /page_objects.

Steps to run the tests:

1. Install Node.js.
2. Install the dependencies with "npm install".
3. Run the app with "nodemon index.js".
4. On a seperate terminal, run the tests with "npm run codeceptjs".

The tests are only written for the sign up and sign in pages for the admin panel.
